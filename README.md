# ProblemSolvingPython

My Weekend open source project. Since I am not pushing anything
to my personal git, I decided to pick something to solve over 1 hour every sunday and push it in to this repo. The codes are not perfect, and it might be buggy; but it helps me to learn and think of different ways to solve problems.

There might be 'pythonic' ways to solve these problems more easily; I try to avoid using libraries, that forces me to think about the problem from different angle.
