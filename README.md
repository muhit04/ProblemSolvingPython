# ProblemSolvingPython

My Weekend open source project. Since I am not pushing anything
to my personal git, I decided to pick something to solve over 1 hour every sunday and push it in to this repo. The codes are not perfect, and it might be buggy; but it helps me to learn and think of different ways to solve problems.

There might be 'pythonic' ways to solve these problems more easily. But I'm not trying to find the most optimized solution here anyway! Maybe that might be a later project?
